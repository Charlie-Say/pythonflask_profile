# pythonflask_profile
Web App using Python Flask

Develop and design a web application using Python Flask.

The web application will begin as a project which will then become a server where users can create profiles, upload blogs, update project ideas/information, etc. It will bring functionality to showcase the users current projects and updates through social media. The project will then evolve into a porfolio website where users can bring and use at interviews or potential employers. It will bring all professional weblinks such as Github.com and LinkedIn.com into one site, which will be treated as a social media site where users can follow eachother and collaborate on ideas.
